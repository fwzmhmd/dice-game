# Dice Game
Simple dice game between 2 players

# How to Play
Game is for 2 Players.


Click roll dice to roll a number between 1 and 6.

That number goes into your CURRENT score.

If you wish you can add your CURRENT score to your GLOBAL score...

But if you roll a 1 you lose all your current score (not GLOBAL) and it moves on to the next player.

The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
